          destroyed due to treacherous wildfires. It is difficult to predict and detect Forest Fire in a sparsely populated forest 
          area and it is more difficult if the prediction is done using ground-based methods like Camera or Video-Based approach. 
          Satellites can be an important source of data prior to and also during the Fire due to its reliability and efficiency. 
          The various real-time forest fire detection and prediction approaches, with the goal of informing the local fire authorities.
